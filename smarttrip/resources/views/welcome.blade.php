            <p>Smart Trip is a young and experienced Company in Florence, who wants to offer its skills and services to foreign students: tours, excursions and other activities. Weâ€™ve got the know-how and a young, lively team of tour leaders. We aim to offer alternative and enjoyable trips to those students who want to make the most of their European experience.
We not only run excursions to and from Italy and its beautiful landscapes and cities, but also to many international destinations, such as Interlaken, Munchen, Budapest and others!</p>
